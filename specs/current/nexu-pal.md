# nexu-pal

GitHub issue/discussion automation around **nexu-pal** issue processing and Feishu notifications.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Script |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `nexu-pal: issue opened` | `issues: [opened]` | `scripts/nexu-pal/process-issue-opened.mjs` |
| `nexu-pal: triage command` | `issue_comment: [created]` (issues only) | `scripts/nexu-pal/process-triage-command.mjs` |
| `Feishu Issue Notification` | `issues: [opened]` | `scripts/notify/feishu-notify.mjs` |
| `nexu-pal: needs-triage notify` | `issues: [labeled]` (when label is `needs-triage`) | `scripts/notify/feishu-triage-notify.mjs` |
| `Feishu Discussion Notification` | `discussion: [created]` | `scripts/notify/feishu-notify.mjs` |
| `Feishu Pull Request Notification` | `pull_request: [opened]` | `scripts/notify/feishu-notify.mjs` |

## On issue opened

Runs in order:

1. **First-time contributor welcome** — Uses `actions/first-interaction@v3`. If the author has never opened an issue in this repo before, posts a welcome comment.

2. **Language detection & translation** — Sends the issue title and body to an LLM (`google/gemini-2.5-flash` via OpenRouter). If the issue is already mostly English and minor non-English text does not affect the meaning, it skips translation. When translation is needed, it translates only the non-English parts, groups them by title / section heading when possible, posts only those translated sections in a comment, adds the `ai-translated` label, and uses the translated result internally for downstream classification.

3. **Intent classification** — Sends the normalized English title and body to the LLM and assigns only the `bug` label when the issue clearly describes broken behavior.

4. **Internal-member short-circuit** — The workflow checks whether `issue.user.login` belongs to the repository owner's GitHub organization via the org-membership API. If the author is an org member, the opened-issue flow stops after translation + bug classification. The same short-circuit also applies to Sentry automation issues authored by `sentry[bot]` (GitHub App actor). These internal-equivalent issues skip known-issue matching, completeness checks, and `needs-triage` labeling.

5. **Completeness check** — For authors that are not internal or internal-equivalent, uses the LLM to decide whether the issue is too incomplete to continue triage. If so, adds `needs-information`, posts a follow-up comment, and pauses there.

6. **Triage label** — For authors that are not internal or internal-equivalent, if the issue is not roadmap-matched and does not need more information, adds the `needs-triage` label.

The opened-issue flow is split into a small pipeline:

- `process-issue-opened.mjs` is the workflow entrypoint.
- `lib/triage-opened-engine.mjs` builds a stable `TriagePlan` shape.
- `lib/github-client.mjs` executes the plan.

Current Phase 3 behavior keeps roadmap and duplicate detection as no-op stubs, but the shared `TriagePlan` / executor contract already supports:

- `commentsToAdd`
- `labelsToAdd`
- `labelsToRemove`
- `closeIssue`

## On `/triage` issue comment

Runs on `issue_comment: [created]` for issues only.

1. **Command parsing** — Supports `/triage accepted`, `/triage declined`, and `/triage duplicated`.
2. **Permission check** — Looks up collaborator permission through the GitHub API and only executes for `write` or `admin` users.
3. **State transition** — Applies the resulting `TriagePlan` via the shared GitHub issue client, using the GitHub App token so all mutations are authored by the app.

Current transitions:

- `/triage accepted` — add `triage:accepted`, remove `needs-triage` / `needs-information`, add acceptance comment.
- `/triage declined` — add `triage:declined`, remove `needs-triage` / `needs-information`, add decline comment, close the issue.
- `/triage duplicated` — add `triage:duplicated`, remove `needs-triage` / `needs-information` / `possible-duplicate`, add duplicate comment, close the issue.

## Feishu notifications

Four GitHub Actions send Feishu webhook notifications for GitHub content:

1. **Issue notification** — On `issues: [opened]`, sends the existing issue card to the issue notification webhook (`NOTIFY_ISSUE_FEISHU_WEBHOOK`), but skips notifications when the author is a repository-owner organization member or `sentry[bot]`.
2. **Needs-triage issue notification** — On `issues: [labeled]`, when the added label is `needs-triage`, sends a triage card to either the bug or non-bug webhook based on the issue's current labels. The workflow maps GitHub secrets to internal env vars `BUG_WEBHOOK` and `REQ_WEBHOOK`.
3. **Discussion notification** — On `discussion: [created]`, sends the existing discussion card format using the discussion category in place of labels to the discussion notification webhook (`NOTIFY_DISCUSSION_ISSUE_FEISHU_WEBHOOK`), but skips notifications when the author is a repository-owner organization member or `sentry[bot]`.
4. **Pull request notification** — On `pull_request: [opened]`, sends the existing card format using pull request labels to the pull-request notification webhook (`NOTIFY_PR_FEISHU_WEBHOOK`), but skips notifications when the author is a repository-owner organization member or `sentry[bot]`.

The issue/discussion/pull-request workflows run `node scripts/notify/feishu-notify.mjs`. The triage workflow runs `node scripts/notify/feishu-triage-notify.mjs`.

## Labels managed

| Label | Added when | Removed when |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| `ai-translated` | Non-English issue detected and translated into a public comment | — |
| `bug` | LLM classifies as bug | — |
| `needs-information` | LLM determines the issue is too incomplete to continue triage | `/triage *` terminal transitions for manual override; automatic re-entry is not implemented yet |
| `needs-triage` | Issue opened, not roadmap-matched, and complete enough for manual triage | `/triage *` terminal transitions |
| `triage:accepted` | `/triage accepted` by a `write` / `admin` collaborator | superseded by a later `/triage` terminal action |
| `triage:declined` | `/triage declined` by a `write` / `admin` collaborator | superseded by a later `/triage` terminal action |
| `triage:duplicated` | `/triage duplicated` by a `write` / `admin` collaborator | superseded by a later `/triage` terminal action |

## Authentication

The three **nexu-pal** workflows create a short-lived token via `actions/create-github-app-token@v1` using secrets `NEXU_PAL_APP_ID` and `NEXU_PAL_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`. All GitHub API calls and the first-interaction action use this App token.

The issue / discussion / pull-request Feishu notification workflows also create a short-lived GitHub App token so they can reuse the org-membership check and suppress notifications for organization-member internal authors; they also suppress `sentry[bot]` as internal-equivalent automation. The `needs-triage` Feishu workflow continues to use GitHub Actions event data plus Feishu incoming-webhook secrets.

## Secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `NEXU_PAL_APP_ID` | GitHub App ID |
| `NEXU_PAL_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM` | GitHub App private key |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | OpenRouter base URL |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenRouter API key |
| `NOTIFY_ISSUE_FEISHU_WEBHOOK` | Feishu incoming webhook URL for the issue-opened notifications |
| `NOTIFY_DISCUSSION_ISSUE_FEISHU_WEBHOOK` | Feishu incoming webhook URL for the discussion-created notifications |
| `NOTIFY_PR_FEISHU_WEBHOOK` | Feishu incoming webhook URL for the pull-request-opened notifications |
| `ISSUE_TRIAGE_BUG_FEISHU_WEBHOOK` | Feishu incoming webhook URL for bug triage notifications |
| `ISSUE_TRIAGE_REQ_FEISHU_WEBHOOK` | Feishu incoming webhook URL for non-bug triage notifications |
